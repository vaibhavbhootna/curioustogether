Saanen Railway Station: The Iconic 'Palat' Moment

Our journey started at Saanen Railway Station, which holds a special place in Bollywood history. This is where Raj (Shah Rukh Khan) and Simran (Kajol) had their unforgettable 'Palat' moment in DDLJ. Standing at this very station, you can almost hear Raj saying, "Palat... Palat... Palat..." and feel the nostalgia hit you.

Just 200 meters from the station, there is a bridge where the famous DDLJ poster of Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol is displayed. It's an absolute must-visit spot for every Bollywood fan who wants to relive the magic of this iconic film.

The Famous DDLJ Bridge: Reliving the Bollywood Dream

We finally reached the DDLJ Bridge, and it was a surreal experience! This is the exact spot where countless fans have taken photos, living their own Bollywood dreams. The bridge is quite busy with passing vehicles, but with a little patience, you can capture the perfect shot.

For many, including me, visiting this bridge has been a childhood dream. Seeing it in real life, after growing up watching DDLJ, was an emotional and unforgettable moment. If you're a Bollywood fan, this place is simply unmissable!

The Legendary Running Scene & DDLJ Memories

Another major highlight was visiting Gstaad, where Shah Rukh Khan‚Äôs famous running scene against an airplane was shot. The area also has multiple DDLJ posters, keeping the movie‚Äôs memory alive. Though Saanen itself is a small and quiet place, it has become a pilgrimage for Bollywood fans over the years.

Gstaad: The Bollywood Town of Switzerland

From Saanen, we headed straight to Gstaad, also known as the 'Bollywood Town' of Switzerland. Many Bollywood movies have been shot here, including the famous Jara Sa Jhoom Loon Main song from DDLJ, Bachna Ae Haseeno, and even some scenes from Ae Dil Hai Mushkil.

As soon as you step into Gstaad, the beauty of the town mesmerizes you. With charming streets, colorful houses, and a cozy European vibe, this place feels straight out of a fairytale. It‚Äôs no wonder that Bollywood stars frequently visit for their holidays!

Shopping & Dining in Gstaad

Apart from being a Bollywood hotspot, Gstaad is also famous for its luxury shopping. You‚Äôll find stores from high-end brands like Dolce & Gabbana, Louis Vuitton, and more. For food lovers, the town also has several great restaurants, including those serving Indian cuisine‚Äîbecause let‚Äôs face it, no matter where we go, we Indians love our food!

It was surprising to see so many Indians in Switzerland. At times, it felt like we were in Toronto or even back in India, with Indian tourists everywhere. Whether at tourist spots or just walking around, the presence of Indian travelers was undeniable!

The Stunning Train Journey to Gstaad

One of the best parts of our journey was the breathtaking train ride to Gstaad. If you‚Äôre planning a trip, I highly recommend taking the Panorama Train from Interlaken to Gstaad. The landscapes along the way are jaw-droppingly beautiful, with stunning valleys, picturesque villages, and snow-capped mountains.

Though we visited in November, which is considered an off-season, the views were still spectacular. The fall colors, the peaceful atmosphere, and the crisp air made the entire experience even more special.
