We started from **Interlaken West**, taking the train to **Grindelwald Terminal**, where we boarded the **Eiger Express gondola**. This modern cable car ride provided a stunning aerial view of the mountains. From **Eigergletscher**, we continued on the **Jungfraubahn**, which took us through tunnels carved inside the Eiger and Mönch mountains, finally arriving at **Jungfraujoch**.

**Exploring Jungfraujoch: The Top of Europe – A Breathtaking Adventure**

### **Story of our visit!**

Day of our Swiss adventure began in Interlaken, where we were staying at Interlaken West. Our destination for the day: Jungfraujoch! To get there, we first needed to travel to Interlaken Ost, the main train station, and from there, take a train to Grindelwald Terminal.

The morning was misty, with thick clouds covering the sky, adding to the mystery of the journey ahead. As we walked along the river, the crisp mountain air and the sight of towering peaks in the distance set the perfect tone for an exciting adventure. Anayasha, my little one, and her mom were bundled up in warm coats, ready to embrace the snowy landscapes awaiting us.

### **The Most Advanced Cable Car Ride: Eiger Express**

Arriving at Grindelwald Terminal, we were about to experience one of the most advanced cable cars in the world – the _Eiger Express_. This modern marvel has significantly reduced the travel time to Jungfraujoch, cutting a journey that once took over two hours down to just 45 minutes!

Boarding the spacious cable car, which comfortably seats 15-20 people, we were treated to a stunning panoramic view of the Grindelwald valley. As we glided above the snowy slopes, the excitement built up – we were getting closer to the famous Jungfraujoch!

### **Train Through the Heart of the Mountain**

After a short stop at Eiger Glacier, we switched to the legendary _Jungfraubahn_ – a cogwheel train that has been running since 1912. This railway is an engineering marvel, as it cuts through the Eiger mountain, carving its way through tunnels to reach Europe’s highest railway station.

Sitting inside, it was hard to believe that we were ascending to such a high altitude. The train ride was smooth, and the tunnels made the journey even more surreal. Halfway through, we made a brief stop at Eismeer station, where we stepped out to witness breathtaking glacier views through panoramic windows.

### **Welcome to the Top of Europe!**

Finally, we arrived at Jungfraujoch! Stepping out of the train, we were greeted by icy winds and a stunning 360-degree view of the Aletsch Glacier, the longest glacier in the Alps.

As we explored, we found a beautifully designed observatory and learning center, where we were surprised by a heartwarming _Happy Diwali_ message displayed on the screens. It was fascinating to learn about the history of Jungfraujoch, including the visionaries who made this incredible railway a reality.

### **Snow, Sun, and Slippery Adventures**

Stepping outside, we found ourselves surrounded by a vast expanse of snow. The ground beneath our feet was a mix of soft powder and hardened ice, making it essential to wear the right footwear. Pro tip: bring sunglasses and sunscreen! The reflection of the sun on the snow makes the UV rays intense, and trust me, you don’t want to get sunburned in freezing weather.

We ventured a little further, walking along the accessible pathways. Seeing people preparing ski tracks and clearing snow for the upcoming ski season was a sight to behold. We also spotted the iconic location where Bollywood’s _Chandni_ was filmed – a nostalgic moment for every Indian traveler!

### **Anaisha's Unexpected Reaction**

While we were thrilled to be at the Top of Europe, Our three old daughter Anaisha had mixed feelings. The little one was excited initially, but the mix of cold wind and bright sun left her confused – “Am I feeling hot or cold?” she asked. We couldn’t help but laugh as she tried to make sense of the paradox.

### **The Ice Palace: A Walk Through Frozen Art**

One of the highlights of Jungfraujoch is the _Ice Palace_ – an entire tunnel carved from ice, featuring intricate ice sculptures of animals, birds, and even a grand piano. Walking through the slippery corridors, we marveled at the craftsmanship and unique experience of being inside a glacier.

Holding my phone in gloved hands, I quickly realized how cold it really was – my fingers started going numb despite the insulation! This truly was a frozen wonderland, unlike anything I had ever seen before.

### **A Must-Visit Destination!**

Jungfraujoch is an experience of a lifetime – from breathtaking train rides to mesmerizing glacier views, from the thrill of stepping into the snow to the charm of walking through an ice-carved museum. Whether you’re an adventure seeker, a nature lover, or a Bollywood fan reliving iconic movie moments, this place has something magical for everyone.

As we took one last look at the snowy peaks before heading back, I knew that this trip to the _Top of Europe_ would stay with us forever. Switzerland, you never fail to amaze!
