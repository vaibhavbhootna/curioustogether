Our journey in one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, Vienna, began with a visit to St. Stephen’s Cathedral. This historic landmark, known as Stephansplatz, is the heart of Vienna. The moment we arrived, we treated ourselves to some delicious European ice cream, which was both tasty and reasonably priced at just 4 euros for a double scoop.

### St. Stephen’s Cathedral – A Gothic Marvel

Standing in front of St. Stephen’s Cathedral, we were in awe of its grand architecture. Originally built in 1147, the cathedral features two towers: the North Tower and the South Tower. Visitors can climb the South Tower for a panoramic view of Vienna at a ticket price of 8 euros, but since it was a foggy day, we decided to admire the cathedral from the ground. Inside, the cathedral is stunning, with beautifully tinted glass windows and a peaceful ambiance. The sound of bells ringing during prayers made the experience even more magical.

### Exploring Vienna’s Lively Streets

Vienna seamlessly blends modern city life with historical charm. The streets are lined with fancy stores, vibrant crowds, and a happening atmosphere. Even on a Monday, the city felt alive! We couldn't tell whether the crowd was mostly tourists or locals, but one thing was certain—Vienna is a perfect place to celebrate special moments like birthdays.

### Schönbrunn Palace – A Festive Wonderland

Next, we headed to Schönbrunn Palace, one of Vienna’s most famous attractions. The palace was surrounded by a lively Christmas market, reminiscent of an Indian fair. There were beautifully decorated Christmas trees, stalls selling festive treats, and fun rides for kids. The evening lights made the whole place look magical. While entry to the palace costs 30 euros, we chose to enjoy the festive ambiance outside, capturing plenty of photos and reels.

### A Memorable Birthday Celebration

For lunch, we visited Spice of India, an Indian restaurant in Vienna, to celebrate a special occasion—my birthday! The food was absolutely delicious, making it a perfect meal to mark the day. But the highlight of the trip? The epic cake-cutting moment! My little one, Anayasha, stole the show with her excitement, making the celebration even more memorable.

### Vienna at Night – A Spectacular Sight

After dinner, we strolled through Vienna’s historical landmarks, including the Opera House and Parliament House, which looked even more mesmerizing under the night lights. Vienna truly transforms at night, offering a breathtaking view of its grand architecture. We also came across the Embassy of India and indulged in some chocolate shopping at one of Vienna’s famous stores.

### A Fun Fact About Vienna

During our walk, we spotted a Cannabis World shop, selling a variety of legal cannabis products like weed, hash oil, and edibles. It was interesting to see how different the legal stance on cannabis is here compared to India.

### Wrapping Up Our European Adventure

As our Europe trip came to an end, we made our way to Vienna Central Station, ready to head to the airport for our flight to Singapore. Reflecting on our journey, we realized how much we had experienced—from Vienna’s stunning churches to its bustling markets and delicious food.

### Travel Tip: When to Visit Europe

If you're planning a trip to Europe in November, it’s best to visit in the first week or by the end of October. After that, the weather turns extremely cold, and cable cars shut down, limiting sightseeing options. While we enjoyed our winter experience, Switzerland’s weather was perfect throughout our stay, making it a top recommendation for future travelers.
